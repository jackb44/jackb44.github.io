        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background-color: #8a9cf4; padding: 10px;">Prospect Park</h1>
        <p>In 1867, Prospect Park officially opened its doors to the public, and even 150 years later, it’s still beloved by residents all over the city and has managed to maintain its high-quality maintenance over that period. It was initially designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who were also responsible for designing parts of Central Park. Originally, the vision was to create one massive park that extended towards Jamaica, but that was impossible due to the rapid urbanization of the city. Then the image shifted from having another massive park that was a top landmark in New York to creating an accessible park for exercise, socializing, and fresh air. A simple but wonderful use. Everything in a park should be, in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>That isn’t to say Prospect Park is small by any means, and it is still massive with dozens of activities and countless places to venture off to. However, in my opinion, it also isn’t too big, and it’s the right amount of everything. Not too many people that it starts to feel like the rest of the city is always crowded and noisy, but not too few that it would start to feel lonely and almost not like New York. Prospect Park is truly a special place in New York and my life because it’s different from everywhere else, but it still feels normal, and that has not changed in 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>As I grew up, I eventually started spending less and less time in Prospect Park and more time around the rest of New York City. I started seeing things that weren’t previously there. More dirt and trash were in places I hadn’t previously seen. With fewer smiling faces on the streets, people always focused on themselves and where they had to be. More lousy language from random strangers yelling at each other that I hadn’t heard before. I smelled smoke and piss, which I hadn’t picked up on when I was younger. This all became extremely common in my everyday life as I got older and has almost become second nature to me at this point. Being busy with school work or extracurriculars, I didn't have much time to myself, and when I did, I usually preferred to be inside sleeping, watching TV and movies, or playing video games. However, after one particularly long day at school, I decided I needed to clear my head and destress before getting home. It was a nice day out, and I decided what better way to distress than to have a calm walk through Prospect Park, the place I had spent so much of my childhood. As I was walking, feelings of reminiscence and nostalgia filled me more deeply than they had before, and I spent a few minutes trying to figure out why since I had been to the park multiple times in the past, even after I started high school. Then I began to realize why. It was so peaceful, calm, and simple. Something that had become somewhat of an anomaly to me over the past year as I was in the city every day. The noisy, crowded, and dirty city The city was filled with racial injustice, violent crimes, a rising homeless and mental health population, unsanitary sidewalks, and unreliable public transportation. A city that was, for the most part, depressed. As much as people and the media don’t want to admit it, so many are depressed living in this city, and for good reason. The quality of life isn’t that great. They never have the time or the place for themselves and are always stressed out. And for a while, I started to feel a little of what it was like. But all of those feelings washed away as I had just taken the time to slow down on this Thursday afternoon and come to this park. This place wasn’t crowded, it wasn’t noisy, it wasn’t even dirty, and it’s a park! Yet, this wasn’t upstate, Long Island, or somewhere else out in the country; it was New York City, the same place where all of those previously mentioned problems are so prevalent in most everyday lives and plague the city. I’m very grateful that when I got older, I realized how Prospect Park is a place for many people to escape the rest of New York while still being in New York.
